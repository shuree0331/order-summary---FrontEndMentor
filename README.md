## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Doing this challenge, I have learned little about what Responsive Design is and how it works like using <u>@media query</u> and <u>< meta > tag</u> and some other new css styling tools I used. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    /* For mobile phone */
    body {
        height: 97vh;
    }
```


### Continued development

I would continuously develop my current skill on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and would love to learn more about React.js and some other languages to extend my knowledge on this new area.

### Useful resources

- [Stackflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) - This helped me for some CSS tools such as <u>text-decoration</u> and <u>line-height</u> etc... I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Web Docs mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This is an amazing website which helped me to remember some usage of tools for HTML, CSS and JS . I'd highly recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
